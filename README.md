## 🚀 Features

### 🔍 Full Diagnostic Scan
Run a comprehensive diagnostic scan to identify stuck pixels, dead zones, and color irregularities. The scan cycles through primary colors and gradients to reveal imperfections invisible to the naked eye.

### 💊 Surgical Repair (HealerBox)
Target specific areas of your screen with the **HealerBox**. This mode allows you to drag and resize a high-frequency flashing zone over stuck pixels to unstuck them without affecting the rest of the display.
- **Extreme Mode**: Increases flashing frequency for stubborn pixels.

### 🧹 Noise Wiper
A full-screen static noise generator designed to exercise all pixels simultaneously. This mode is effective for general screen conditioning and fixing widespread stuck pixels.

### 🧪 Screen Test
Manually cycle through solid colors to visually inspect your screen for defects.

### ⚠️ Epilepsy Warning
Safety first. The application includes a mandatory epilepsy warning due to the high-frequency flashing lights used in repair modes.
